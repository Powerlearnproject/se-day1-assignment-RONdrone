# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
This is a process that appears engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems
IMPORTANCE  IN TECH
.collaboration _promotes team work and collaboration
.cost efficient _companies can easily avoid costly mistakes 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
.structured programming has  enhanced code readability  making it easy to maintain and manage large and complex codes
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
.requirement gathering _collecting information about what the software should do
.design_planning the architecture and features of the software
.implementation _writign the code to create the software
.testing_checking the software for bugs and errors
.deployment_releasing the software to users
.maintenance _updating and fixing the software after it's been deployed 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
.watefall_ a liner approach where each phase  must be complete  before moving to the next
.agile_ an iterative approach that allows for flexibility and continued feedback
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
.software developer _ writes and maintains codes
.quality assurance engineer _ tests the software to find and fix issues  ensuring quality 
.project manager  _ plans, coordinates ,and manages the project to ensure it is completed on time
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
.IDE:provides tools like code editors debugger  and compilers in one place
.VCS:track changes in code, making it easy to manage multiple versions and collaborate with others.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
.meeting  deadlines;break tasks into smaller chunks and use project management tools
.debugging complex issues: use systematic  debugger tools
.managing changing requirements:use agile method for flexibility 
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
.unit testing :tests individual components or functions
.integration testing :tests combind  of the system (they work well together)
.system testing test:tests the entire system as a whole
.acceptance testing:validates the software aginst the user needs
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
.the process of crafting inputs to get the desired results from AI_models
.it helps one to get specific information from the AI
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
.vague prompt:tell me about bodybuilding
.improved prompt:explain about building muscle using hypertrophy method
